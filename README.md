MG6023 B, Economics  Strategy 
Spring 2024 
Course Description: This is a course in Economics, Strategy, and the Firm with   a primary   focus   on the needs   of   managers.   It   draws upon   a range   of concepts   and tools   from   the   fields   of Industrial   Organization   and   Strategic   Management to review the cognitive building blocks that provide an economic foundation to strategic   thinking.   Strategy   is   ultimately   about   value   creation   and   capture   of   economic   value.   Value-based strategies   show   that   a   firm   that   introduces   a   technological   innovation   creates   value,   and   if it   fails   to   protect it from competition it will be driven out of   business. This basic level of   insight   is   linked to the   rich   tradition   in   economics   to   untangle   some   ambiguities   surrounding   these   concepts   and   provide   a   deeper understanding of strategic decisions made by managers within the bounds imposed by   competition.
Course Objective: 
After completing this course, students should be   able to:
•         Explain   the   structure   of   the   industry   in   which   a   firm   competes   and   the   nature   of   the competitive interactions among firms in those markets.
•         Articulate   the   differences   in   the   firms' positions   to   compete   and   the   basis   of   their   competitive advantage.
Course Structure: The   course   relies   on   a   combination   of   lectures,   in-class   discussions,   and   students'   presentations.   Chances are that   students, who have invested   quality time   to   prepare   for   class   will   initiate   a   valuable   discussion during my lectures. Notice that the   last   one   or   two   sessions   (depending   on   class   size)   will   be devoted to students' presentations.
Readings: 
Lecture Notes Your   lecture notes provide the basic reading   material   and   serve   as   a   subject   guide.   Study   the   lecture   notes first, and then the additional readings and the corresponding chapters   in the textbook.   As   a rule,   your   exams   are   designed   to   test   your   basic   knowledge,   and   questions   will   be   drawn   for   the   lecture   notes.
Textbook 
The   textbook emphasizes strategic   behavior. and covers a   wide   range of   topics in great detail. However,   please note that there is no single textbook that includes all topics   covered   in the   course.

Course Assignments and Grading: 
What's the point? 
This project should be considered a laboratory in which you can   test   your   ability   to   identify   and   clearly   explain complex strategic issues. You will write several reports based on   articles   that   you   select   from the Wall   Street Journal. You are required to submit one-page written reports based on   your   articles.   I will   call   a   student   to   open   the   class   discussion   with   a   brief   presentation   of   his/her what 's the point? report that has been prepared beforehand.
A good report is expected to have the following   structure:
"What's the point?" 
Your Name:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Due Date:
What's the Point?This is your general brief   statement, the strategic lesson you have learned by analyzing   the   article.      Do not simply repeat the title of   the article. Notice that you might be able to   derive   several   lessons,   but you will select   and focus   on   only   one point.
Source:
List the data and title of   the   WSJ   article.
Analysis:
o   Part   1. Plan of   Action. Describe the actions taken by management and the economic characteristics   of   the   decision   that   makes   it   strategic.
o   Part 2.   Situation. Explain the strategic issue that managers had to address.
o   Part 3. Objective  Outcome. Explain the logic   i.e., how   the   actions   improve   the   situation.
o   Part 4. Generality. Explain if   this is   a   problem   that   other   companies   (even   in   different   industries)   are facing now or could be   facing in   the   future?
Research Project The   class will be   divided to   groups to   complete   an   industry   research   paper.   An   up   to   15-page   double-   spaced   report   will   be   prepared   to   showcase   your   research,   not   including   accompanying   bibliography.   The report should be a professional-looking document that relies heavily on the topic discussed in class   to draw its   conclusions.
Your industry and competitive analysis report should follow   the   following   structure:
Title The title   summarizes the main   idea   or   ideas   of   your   study. A   good   title   contains   the   fewest   possible   words   that   adequately   describe   the   contents   and/or   purpose   of   your   research   paper.   If   the   title   is   too long it usually contains too many unnecessary words, e.g., "A Study to Investigate the...." On the other   hand,   a   title   which   is   too   short   often   uses   words   which   are   too   general.   For   example,   "The   U.S.   Pharmaceutical Industry" could be the title of   a research paper, but it does not provide any information   on   the   focus   of the   research.   A better   title   could be:   “A New   Business   Model   for   Pharma:   How   the   Pandemic   Changed   Priorities.”
I.                         The Research Statement. The   research   statement   conveys   the   overall   intent   of   the   study   i.e., why you are writing this report. The purpose of   the statement is to guide your research   and it must be clear, specific, and informative to   stimulate readers’   interest.
II.                      Macro-analysis. Use   the   PEST/PESTEL   framework   to   identify   emerging   trends   in   the   macro-environment   of the   selected   industry.   Although   this   is   a   broad   discussion   of the   emerging trends that could influence the industry, the emphasis should be on trends related   to your research statement.
III.                Industry Analysis. The five-forces   framework   for industry   analysis   is   the   main   tool   to be   used   in   this   part   of   the   research   which   has   two   parts:
a.       Describe   the current structure   of the   industry   and   its   ability   to   capture   part   of the   value   it creates.
b.      Next,   explain   how   your   findings   in   the   macro-analysis   section   could   impact   the   industry's   structure in the future and its   ability to   capture value.
IV.                Situation    Analysis. Select    a    company   within   the    industry   and   use   SWOT   analysis   to   understand the company’s situation within the industry.
a.       Strengths   and Weaknesses   (SW) refers   to   the current internal   environment   of   the   firm   which   will   be   analyzed   with   the   use   of   the   business   model   canvas.
b.       Opportunities   and   Threats   (OT)   refers   to   the emerging external   environment   o代 写MG6023 B, Economics & Strategy Spring 2024

c.       How    the    current      business      model      is      expected      to      perform      within      the      emerging      external   environment.V. Business    Model    Innovation. Complete   your   report   with    a    statement   like    "Given   theexpected changes in the   structure of   the   industry,   it   is   advisable   for   the   focus   company   to   implement   the   proposed   business   model   modifications"   followed   by   a   description   of the   improved business model.
***
A research statement (maximum length one to two pages) should be submitted for   approval.   It should include the preliminary title of   the research paper, and it will introduce a   question which could be further explored through research. A good research question involves more efforts   than   just a guess. It is a specific testable research hypothesis   about what you   expect to happen   in   an   industry.      Visit the websites of   several consulting firms to start thinking about   alternative   research   questions:

https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/gx/en/insights/industry-trends.html 
The research paper will be evaluated along the following dimensions: Cohesiveness. The   writers provide   a   clear research   statement   and   concluding   remarks   that   are   fully   supported by the analysis. The paper ties together information, and it flows from one topic to the next. Integration    of Knowledge. The    paper    demonstrates    that    the    authors    fully    understand    and      can   synthesize using the concepts learned in the course.
Spelling  Grammar. No   spelling   and/or grammar mistakes.   The paper   should have   a professional   appearance.
Citations. The paper   cites   all   data   and   text   obtained   from   other   sources.   It   employs   a uniform   style   throughout the paper.Academic   writing   follows   specific   styles,   and   each   style   has   different   peculiarities   and   distinctive   features.   The   most   common   styles   are:   American   Psychological   Association   (APA)   style,   Modern   Language   Association   (MLA)   style,   and   the   Chicago   style.   Use   the   one   that   fits   your   style,   but   be   consistent. Notice that Word will format your paper based on the selected   style.
Evaluation of Team Research 
Every team member initially receives the same grade for the research paper.    However, the individual   grade is adjusted after a peer-review   evaluation.
Let’s   assume   that   there   are   n   members   on   a   team.   Then   each   member   will   have   10(n-1)   points   to   allocate   to    other    team   members.    The    allocation    should    reflect    your   judgment    about    everyone’s   contribution to the project. If   the grade for the research paper is x   and you receive k points   from your teammates, then the individual grade will be computed as: x +   10   {   ((k/10(n-1))-1},   capped   at   100.
For example, in a 4-person team, each member gets 30 points to allocate to the other members as they   please. If   x = 92.5 and you get 8 points from each teammate, (k=3 x 8 = 24) then your individual score   for the group research project   is: 92.5 +   10{(24/10(4-1)) -1} =   90.5
Forum. Participation in the discussion forums is required and   critical   for maximizing   student learning in this course, both because your participation is graded and because it's   a   chance to   engage   in a dialogue about course material.   Submit the requested initial post, and   then post   your reflections      on at least one   other person's post.
Examinations There   will   be   two   exams.   Both   exams   will   ask   you   to   answer   multiple-choice   questions   and   are   designed   to   test   your   basic   knowledge   in   the   subject   area.   All   questions   will   be   selected   from   the   material you will find in your lecture notes.

Grading Policy Late   works   Students   are   reminded   that   grades   are   not   "given"   but   reflect   what   is   "earned"   by   the   student   through   course   performance   along   clearly   established   dimensions,   and   not   what   they   have   (falsely) learned   to "expect" or   managed   to   negotiate   with   the instructor, or   what   the instructor   believes   is the effort level or commitment. A   rather normal   distribution   will   be   constructed   around   the   overall   class   average   grade.   By   this   very   definition,   it   should   not   be   expected   that   a   significantly   large   percentage of   the class receives an A in the course.   At   the   other   end   of   the   grade   distribution, poor   or unacceptable   performance will   carry   a   grade   below   B-.
